        <p1 class="paragraph">Hi! I am Monica Rodriguez. I am originally from Costa Rica and I have been in the US for the last 3 years. I am a former lawyer who recently found her passion in tech! Simply the limitless posibilities of being able to create something that will create value for others captivated me and push my limits into a new world that its surprising for me. 
        
        Curiosity has been my main driver as a professional. It allowed me to learn 4 different languages (Spanish, English, German and Portuguese), live in 3 different countries (Costa Rica, Germany, and the US) and pursue multiple, yet complementary career paths including; Intellectual Property Law, Business, Marketing, and Technology.

        My main interest as a professional lies in being able to deliver and communicate the value add that customized technology solutions can create for customers, by optimizing their business processes, reducing costs or maximizing revenue.
        
        By working together with Sales Leaders and Technologist I would love to deliver solutions that not only have a tremendous impact on the bottom line but also are good for the world! 
        </p>
        <p2 class="paragraph">I am also passionate about traveling, reading, writing, cooking and dancing!! You can as well call me a crazy cat lady if you want because I will proudly respond as one.</p2>
